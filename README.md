Application for generating random objects.

1. Create database for an object (for example describing city)
2. Fill its scheme:
    * "Blocks" mean properties ("name" of a city, it's "population", "ruler", etc.)
    * "Paragraphs" mean possible values for each block (for example "population" can be "small", "big", "megapolis", etc.)
3. Press "Generate" to get a random set of paragraphs for each block
